# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Retail Sales Data

## Project Overview
This project performs an exploratory data analysis on a retail sales dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that can help businesses make informed decisions. The analysis provides a comprehensive view of retail operations through various statistical and visual techniques.

## Dataset Description
The project uses two primary datasets:
- `retail_sales_dataset.csv`: Contains 1,000 retail transactions with details about customers, products, and sales
- `menu.csv`: Contains product information with 260 items and their nutritional details

## Features Analyzed
- Customer demographics (gender, age)
- Product categories and preferences
- Sales performance over time (monthly, quarterly, day of week)
- Purchase behavior (quantity, pricing)
- Correlations between variables

## Tools & Technologies
- Python 3
- Libraries:
  - pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
  - numpy: Numerical operations
  - matplotlib: Visualization
  - seaborn: Enhanced visualization

## Key Insights
1. **Customer Demographics**:
   - Analysis of customer gender distribution and age groups
   - Identification of product preferences by demographic segment

2. **Product Performance**:
   - Top-selling product categories
   - Price point analysis across categories

3. **Temporal Patterns**:
   - Monthly sales trends showing seasonal variations
   - Day of week analysis revealing busier shopping periods
   - Quarterly performance evaluation

4. **Purchase Behavior**:
   - Common purchase quantities
   - Spending patterns across customer segments

## Business Recommendations
The analysis concludes with actionable business recommendations for:
- Targeted marketing strategies
- Inventory management optimization
- Pricing strategy refinement
- Customer experience improvements
- Product development opportunities
- Seasonal planning guidance
